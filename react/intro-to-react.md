# Intro to React

Yo! In case you don't know, React is the awesome UI library release by Facebook in 2013.

It allows you to quickly build user interfaces, but leaves the choice of other stuff (HTTP requests, routing, state management) to you.

Here is an example of a React component:

```jsx
const HelloWorld = () => <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
```

That's it! Pretty cool, don't you think?
